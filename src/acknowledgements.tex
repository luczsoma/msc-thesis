I would like to thank my supervisor Márk Asztalos for his advice and enthusiasm, for trusting me, and for letting me work in my own pace.

I would like to thank Roland Hidvégi for creating the corporate identity of Diplomatiq free of charge. I would also wish to express my graditude to my colleagues, Péter Bartha and István Hartung, for pushing me and encouraging me. I would also like to thank Kristóf Marussy for creating this \LaTeX\xspace template.

Last but not least, I am deeply grateful to my girlfriend, my mother, my father, my grandmother and my grandfather for their continuous support and understanding.
