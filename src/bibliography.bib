For social scientists, the theory of networks has been a gold mine, yielding explanations for social phenomena in a wide variety of disciplines from psychology to economics. Here, we review the kinds of things that social scientists have tried to explain using social network analysis and provide a nutshell description of the basic assumptions, goals, and explanatory mechanisms prevalent in the field. We hope to contribute to a dialogue among researchers from across the physical and social sciences who share a common interest in understanding the antecedents and consequences of network phenomena.},

  abstract = {Social network analysis (SNA) is not a formal theory in sociology but rather a strategy for investigating social structures. As it is an idea that can be applied in many fields, we study, in particular, its influence in the information sciences. Information scientists study publication, citation and co-citation networks, collaboration structures and other forms of social interaction networks. Moreover, the Internet represents a social network of an unprecedented scale. In all these studies social network analysis can successfully be applied. SNA is further related to recent theories concerning the free market economy, geography and transport networks. The growth of SNA is documented and a co-author network of SNA is drawn. Centrality measures of the SNA network are calculated.}

  abstract = {Social network sites (SNSs) have rapidly become very popular, challenging even the major portals and search engines in terms of usage and commercial value. This chapter introduces key SNS issues and reviews relevant academic research from sociology, communication science, computer science, and information science. The chapter introduces a broad classification of SNS friendship and demonstrates the range of types of SNS, each with its own unique combination of functionalities and objectives. The users and uses for SNSs are also varied, both in terms of the broad range of reasons for using a site and also, at the microlevel, in terms of the understanding of the core concept of friending. The commonly discussed issues of privacy and security are reviewed, including the extent to which they are taken seriously by users and SNS designers. New forms of electronic communication seem to always generate their own new language varieties and SNS language is briefly discussed. The chapter is supported by a series of MySpace investigations to illustrate key points and give additional information. Finally, the potential for programmers to create small applications to run within SNSs or with SNS data is discussed and speculations made about future developments.}
